# LayoutKit

This is a Swift framework that provides a great deal of support for implementing layouts in code.

Documentation to come later.

LayoutKit is probably a temporary name -- hopefully we'll think of a more unique name that avoids potential naming collisions if Apple decides to make their own LayoutKit one day.
